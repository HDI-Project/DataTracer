## Requirements

**DataTracer** has been developed and tested on [Python 3.5 and 3.6, 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

interfering with other software installed in the system where **DataTracer** is run.

## Install with pip

The easiest and recommended way to install **DataTracer** is using [pip](
https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):

```bash
pip install data-tracer
```

This will pull and install the latest stable release from [PyPi](https://pypi.org/).
